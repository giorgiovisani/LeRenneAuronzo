I have a react web app made of different pages.
I store the data  inside two different jsons one per each language that I want to display (inside the src/locales folder).
In the tailwind navbar I have two buttons activating a languagecontext component that changes the language of my app
by using the usetranslation function from i18next setted up with two different json files per language:
One about all the pages data, the other with the attractions data.
From the attractions page, by clicking on an attraction card, it displays the attraction detail page of that attraction.

I want to migrate all the styling towards NextUI version 2.4.8. Help me switch each page and component to the new styling version
